# `unm_biocomp_hscaf`

Implements the HierS hierarchical scaffold algorithm by Wilkens et al.
Designed for HierS scaffold analysis, for single molecules, datasets, or
common-scaffold comparisons between pairs or groups of molecules.
Built with ChemAxon JChem.

Depends on:

* `unm_biocomp_depict`
* `unm_biocomp_db`
* `unm_biocomp_util`
* `unm_biocomp_http`

Now Mavenized, requiring ChemAxon-Hub Artifactory credentials.
